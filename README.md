　　冶力关风景区是我甘南之行的第四大遗憾。以临潭县冶力关为中心，分为莲花山、西峡、东峡和冶海湖四个景区。主要景观有莲花、冶木峡、冶海湖、赤壁幽谷、巨型卧佛等景观。莲花山位于冶力关东15公里处，主峰海拔3578米，集险、奇、幽、秀于一体，因远眺望去，形似一朵盛开的莲花而得名。又称“西崆峒”，是甘南、临夏两地佛道两教的圣地。历代文人墨客的吟咏遗迹及美丽动人的神话传说甚多。每年农历六月初一至初六，莲花山的群众举办传统的“花儿会”，规模最大的花儿会，赶会者达数万人之多。西峡位于冶木河上游，两岸树木浓荫，山峦叠嶂，冶木河清澈见底。东峡位于冶木河下游，水流湍急，浪花飞溅，两岸古松竹林，青山秀美，主要景点有老虎嘴、喜泉飞瀑、天然巨型卧佛“将军睡千年”等。冶海湖位于冶力关以北5公里处的白石山与庙花山之间，海拔2160米，湖长5公里，湖宽几十米至百米不等，放眼望去，湖水碧波荡漾，烟波浩缈，水光潋滟，四面山青草绿，野花遍地，风光秀美。湖畔山头修有一常爷庙，供有明朝开国大将军常遇春的塑像，当地群众视若保护神，信奉有加，所以也将冶海湖将为“常爷池”。隆冬时节，湖面结冰封冻，冰面呈现出千姿百态的各种冰图令人称奇。当地群众习惯于每年农历腊初八相约前来冶海湖对冰图，预测来年的播种和收成。现在逐渐成为一处游人休闲度假之地。
青黛从远方邮来涟漪，那坡风云就缀满紫藤，是眼角的桔灯挂北斗，是嘴角的米盐翻瓦檐。
